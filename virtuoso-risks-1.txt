Internal Microsoft,
Lack of availabilities from key AXA stakeholders (applications owners),
Lack of availability of bank resources and access to relevant 3rd party resources. The bank has assigned key points of contacts for the core delivery functions at Governance and Programme Levels. This is part of the program/project delivery processes - i.e. highly agile and iterative planning, organizational structure and RACI. For DWP Design Complete, we have successfully mitigated this. Moving forward in the engagement, we will actively mitigate. We continue to proactively planning at the right level of detail in each workstream so as to manage critical path. Our next to-do here will be to investigate if these will change after design complete. Check-In 19th September: mitigation plan is still accurate.,
Lack of Azure deployment, maintenance and support processes to the Claro team,
Lack of business led requirements and decisions,
Lack of clarity and alignment on customer priorities within the bank will mean that DWP stops after Design Complete - flying under the radar and need to sell the DWP implementation in order to get it funded using a credible light-touch plan. We now understand that a major business change programme (a Temenos implementation) is the key IT and business priority in the bank. This will consume banks resources and take priority over most of the new initiatives. The DWP governance committee has given direct feedback that DWP will likely not exist as a programme post Design Complete due to competing forces and that we should seek existing initiatives to tag onto or join. Therefore, there is still a risk with DWP that it stops after design complete as there is no appetite/budget to implement. We are actively mitigating. We have (a) produced a business case/benefits plan to help sell the adoption and value realisation.,

RISK - Delayed Negotiations on WO Amendment and CR for Japan Opt-in,
risk #1,
Risk for timeplan slipping, as both project initiation, resource onboarding, design, plan and build needs to take place within a very short timeframe for reaching DP3,
Risk Model Accuracy may not get to 87% by 18-Aug-2017,

Risk with performance tuning work is not being able to achieve performance that is acceptable to the customer leading to potentially more investment and customer satisfaction issues.,
Risk: Adequate time to train the trainers, business, and all users,
Risk: Clas Ohlson may move AX intended functionality and features back to existing legacy systems (RainDance, PCMS, Neolane & Cores) to make the AX scope fit the budget constraint, which is against the initial Clas Ohlson strategic intention of moving functionality into AX in order to enable Clas Ohlson business to scale and move into new markets in a faster manner without long-duration and costly IT investments.,
Risk: Critical resources have both Microsoft supporting and Entergy supporting remediation tasks,
Risk: Environment Setups, Instance Planning, License Planning, ISV Installation,
Risk: People Constraints through out the business, inadequate resources to support timeline,
Risk: The duration of the Design Phase period (currently planned for 5 weeks with assumed 30 in-scope AX gaps), ranging from Design Phase start until all the FDDs are approved by Clas Ohlson, may not be feasible anymore, as the comparable period and previously observed durations for AX UK Pilot (14 calendar weeks for 17 AX gaps), AX Country Rollout (11 calendar weeks for 11 AX gaps) and AX HQ (14 calendar weeks for 18 AX gaps),
Risk: The E-Com analysis phase may be extended, if the AX/Avensia scope (that Clas Ohlson is willing to financially aim for) is not confirmed and locked before July 31 (for AX) and Aug.14 (for the Avensia), then the AX Design Phase/Avensia Sprint 0 Phases will be delayed in a 1:1 relationship. Complicating this achievement is, that the Clas Ohlson key stakeholders, the Solution Board, is on summer vacation in from July 3 to July 28.,
Risk?The source code will need a security scan called SCAS, any finding is required to be fixed mandatory before system go-live.

Solution?After we get SCAS report, we need work closely with SCAS team and confirm every findings solution.,

The bank have asked for this to be a 3rd party managed programme. This means that MS will be the banks programme manager. Negative risk is that MS could be left to fend for themselves or have little influence on getting activity completed to plan. Mitigation is that this is supported by Governance and by individuals on the ground at the programme level in the bank. Governance are keenly aware of the situation and the move to ask MS to 3rd party manage the programme is being supported by the key IT and business stakeholders and the MS PgM is being supported on the ground by a bank business manager and project manager. Being a 3rd party managed programme is a key COS for the key business and IT stakeholder as the bank is somewhat resource constrained due to Omega.
